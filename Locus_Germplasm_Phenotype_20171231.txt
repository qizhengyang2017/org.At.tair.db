"AT1G02580"	"mea-1"	"In the homozygous progeny:  During early stages of embryogenesis the  development of mea-1 embryos is indistinguishable  from wild-type siblings in cleared  or sectioned specimens. Visible differences  between wild-type and mea-1 embryos  began at the late globular stage. Globular mea-1 embryos show excess  cell proliferation and enlarge radially  symmetrical. When wild-type embryos  reach the mid to late heart stage, sibling  mea-1 embryos are still globular and contain  small vacuolated cells with curvilinear cell  walls and sometimes irregular cell divisions  in the ground tissue and procambium. Suspensor  and hypophysis are normal, and cotyledons  initiate synchronously as in the  wild type. Thus, despite increased cell proliferation  and occasional irregular cytokinesis,  morphogenetic progression is normal.  However, each stage is prolonged and includes  more division cycles, and morphogenesis  is delayed. As a consequence, giant  heart stage mea-1 embryos  are present along with late torpedo or cotyledonary  stage wild-type embryos. mea-1  heart stage embryos have supernumerary  cell layers. When wild-type siblings are  fully differentiated, most mea-1 embryos  have reached the late heart stage and are up  to 10 times larger than normal. mea embryos  degenerate during desiccation. These results  suggest that mea controls cell proliferation  during embryogenesis, allowing morphogenesis  to progress normally, albeit  slowly.  Endosperm development in mea-1 seeds  is indistinguishable from that of the wild  type at early stages. When cellularization  begins normally in wild-type seeds at the  transition from the globular to the heart  stage, no cellularization is observed in sibling  mea-1 seeds. Although nuclear divisions  take place more slowly in mea-1 endosperm,  the distribution of endosperm nuclei  is as in the wild type. Partial cellularization  occurs at the micropyle when mea-1  embryos reach the late heart stage in desiccating  seeds, but because fewer nuclei have  been generated, most of the central cell is  devoid of nuclei. Thus, in mea-1 seeds, the  development of both fertilization products  is delayed but morphogenesis proceeds normally,  and it appears that the embryo shows  increased cell proliferation at the expense  of the endosperm.

Because the mutant stamens often had shorter filaments than the wild type self-pollination was seldom efficient. However, upon manual pollination, pollen from the homozygous mutant plants germinated on self or wild type stigmas and produced fertile seeds, indicating that the mutant pollen grains, although larger, were viable. When homozygous mutant plant was pollinated with wild type pollen, the cross-pollination resulted in near normal development of siliques and production of seeds suggesting that the female development was not affected by the arp4-1 mutation.

Mutant seeds were usually desiccation tolerant at maturity, although their viability was reduced slightly after several weeks of storage. Dry seeds often germinated to produce seedlings with distorted cotyledons. This defect resulted from degeneration of cotyledon tips prior to germination. Some trichomes form on cotyledons after germination and stomata are found on surface of cotyledons of mutant embryos The cotyledon surface on seedlings produced from dry seeds lacked trichomes (likely because any trichomes initiated during embryogenesis did not survive desiccation). Mutant seeds were consequently highly pigmented at maturity and anthocyanins were especially prominent in the top half of the mutant cotyledons. Mutant embryos do not form roots during the first 48 hours of culture. The pattern of storage product accumulation was altered, the hypocotyl was filled with mature protein bodies, while the cotyledons exhibited a gradient of starch and protein accumulation. Cells in the top half of mutant cotyledons were highly vacuolated, packed with starch grains, and lacked mature protein bodies, whereas cells closer to the hypocotyl contained less starch but many protein bodies.

Most of these aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the globular stage as well as ball/oblong-shaped embryos (ca. 75%). The morphogenesis of these embryos was blocked before initiation of cotyledon growth and establishment of bilateral symmetry. The other aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the torpedo or bent cotyledon stage with abnormal- shaped, thickened hypocotyls and underdeveloped cotyledons (ca. 25%). About 10% of all seeds are narrow, containing undersized, tenuous embryos which are not viable."	"15710401  "

Although the ga3ox2 single mutant does not have any phenotype, plants are 30% smaller in leaf diameter and 37% shorter than ga3ox1; therefore, production of bioactive GA by GA3ox2 during early vegetative growth may be sufficient for transport to the stem to induce the partial stem elongation observed in the ga3ox1 mutant, the overall phenotype of the double mutant is consistent with expression patterns of these two genes. The bioactive level of GA4 is severely decreased; while the level of GA9  is drastically increased, compared to wild type plants; exogenous application of GA4, but not GA9, was able to induce seed germination in a dose-dependent manner."

Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers.

Microscopic observation revealed highly disordered root meristem cell patterns, with most walls lacking parallel or perpendicular alignment to the longitudinal axis of the root and most cells exhibiting irregular shapes. Examination of cell wall patterns suggested that misoriented cell divisions were largely responsible for the irregular cell patterns. In pok1/pok2 double mutant embryos, misplaced cell walls were observed as early as the octant stage of embryogenesis. Throughout embryogenesis, the mispositioning of cell walls continues, eventually giving rise to slightly misshapen mature embryos with a stubby appearance, compared to wild-type.

The abnormalities included white sectors in green organs, uneven thickness, rough surfaces, and irregular margins of leaves or floral organs. Stamens occasionally exhibited carpel characteristics indicating homeotic transformation. The rough and uneven sepals apparently resulted from abnormally enlarged  cells as well as cell clusters projecting above the epidermis. The white sectors appeared to result from an absence of chloroplasts in patches of mesophyll cells and the formation of large air spaces or tiny cells in subepidermal cell layers. Occasionally, tso2 mutants exhibited  fasciated stems on which a single SAM, a group of self-renewing cells at the shoot tip, was enlarged and split into multiple SAMs. Finally, tso2 mutants exhibited reduced fertility, with ;29% aborted seeds. tso2-1 floral tissues were found to contain significantly reduced levels of all four dNTPs. tso2-1 exhibited slightly  increased sensitivity to UV-C light, but only at high UV-C light levels."

Also, the C29 alkanes in mutants are nearly 6-fold lower, and the C30 primary alcohols are 4-fold higher compared to the wild type. In contrast to stems, the wax on mutant leaves increased roughly 43% in amount relative to the wild type, with the major increase occurring in the C31 and C33 alkanes. Approximately 70% of mutant seeds are shrunken and nonviable, with these being randomly distributed within both inflorescence and silique. Viable mutant seeds are slightly larger than those of wild type; the proportions of these fatty acids are not significantly different from wild type. Shrunken seeds contain 34% of the fatty acids of wild-type seeds, with proportionally more palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, and less of the longer and more desaturated homologs.

Furthermore, the number of siliques per plant as well as the number of seeds per silique were not altered in the wri1 mutants. Early morphogenesis of the embryo as observed by light microscopy was indistinguishable in the mutants and the wild type, however, during the seed-filling stage triacylglycerols accumulated at a much lower rate in the mutant, and the final amount of triacylglycerols in mature wri1 mutant seeds was reduced by approximately 80%. The fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols extracted from mature wild-type and homozygous wri1 mutant seeds were different. There were only subtle differences in the time courses of protein accumulation during seed development between the mutants and the wild type. It appears that young mutant seeds contain more protein, whereas mature mutant seeds contain slightly less than wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the amounts of soluble sugars, including Suc, Glc, and Fru, were elevated throughout development of wri1 mutant seeds. Mature mutant seeds contained approximately twice as much Suc. However, developing homozygous wri1 seeds were impaired in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols; pyruvate and acetate were incorporated at an increased rate. Because the activities of several glycolytic enzymes, in particular hexokinase and pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, are reduced in developing homozygous wri1 seeds, it is suggested that WRI1is involved in the developmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism during seed filling."

Early morphogenesis of the embryo as observed by light microscopy was indistinguishable in the mutants and the wild type, however, during the seed-filling stage triacylglycerols accumulated at a much lower rate in the mutant, and the final amount of triacylglycerols in mature wri1 mutant seeds was reduced by approximately 80%. The fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols extracted from mature wild-type and homozygous wri1 mutant seeds were different. There were only subtle differences in the time courses of protein accumulation during seed development between the mutants and the wild type. It appears that young mutant seeds contain more protein, whereas mature mutant seeds contain slightly less than wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the amounts of soluble sugars, including Suc, Glc, and Fru, were elevated throughout development of wri1 mutant seeds. Mature mutant seeds contained approximately twice as much Suc. However, developing homozygous wri1 seeds were impaired in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols; pyruvate and acetate were incorporated at an increased rate. Because the activities of several glycolytic enzymes, in particular hexokinase and pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, are reduced in developing homozygous wri1 seeds, it is suggested that WRI1is involved in the developmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism during seed filling."

In rbe-3 flowers with more than four sepals, the extra sepal was thinner than the remaining four sepals. In some cases, one of the adjacent sepals was  also somewhat reduced in width. Sepal fusion can occur in the absence of more than four sepals. Sepal fusion was observed most often at the base of these organs and more rarely along their entire length. We measured the width of mature sepals to determine whether  sepal fusion might be due to wider organs. rbe-3 sepals were 12% wider than Landsberg erecta (Ler) sepals at maturity."	"16412084  "

The pollen of the double mutant is largely defective with about 50-70% nonviability compared to ~0.5% nonviability for wild type pollen. The pollen for rhf1a rhf2a mutants appears to develop normally through PMI, but 30-40% of the pollen grain fail to undergo this mitotic division, and then, of those that did pass through, another 20-30% never go through the next round of cell division (PMII). The variety of different ploidy levels measured in generative cells arrested at the PMII phase indicate that they could be blocked at the G1, S, or G2. Levels of myc:KRP6 increase in the double mutant, suggesting that this protein is a putative substrate of this E3 ubiquitin ligase.

However, in the fourth whorl, where trn2 loss-of-function interferes with the fusion of two carpels to the single style, double mutant flowers were comprised of multiple carpels, most of them fused (73%) as typically found in the clv3-2 mutation. Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers.

In contrast, the number of sepals and petals in the outer perianth whorls in trn2-23010 wus-1 was closer in number to that of the trn2 mutant rather than to wus-1 single mutant flowers.

In contrast to these distinct phenotypes, however, the morphology of the flower organs and the fertility levels are unaffected in ssm plants. Histological analyses revealed that the length of the epidermal cells in the inflorescence stems of ssm plants was shorter that wild type but that the ssm mutation has little or no effect on the lengths of the pith parenchyma cells. Furthermore, the length of the parenchyma cells around the midribs of the rosette leaf petioles is clearly reduced in ssm mutants, whereas the mesophyll cell size in the rosette leaf blades is unaffected."

The activity of the NAD salvage pathway appears to be upregulated in this mutant.
